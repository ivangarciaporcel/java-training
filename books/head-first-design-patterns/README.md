# HEAD FIRST DESIGN PATTERNS (2nd edition)

## Design Principles
### Chapter 1
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance

### Chapter 2
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

### Chapter 3
- Open for extension, closed for modification.

## Design Patterns
- [x] Strategy (Chapter 1)
```
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary 
independently from clients that use it.
```
- [x] Observer (Chapter 2)
```
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are 
notified and updated automatically.
```

- [x] Decorator (Chapter 3)
```
Attaches additional responsabilities to an object dynamically. Decorator provide a flexible alternative to subclassing
for extending functionality
```
